# Book-Store 

## Description:
mern stack book store website i make this website with admin dashboard to manage the content with awsome

stats for authentication i use google firebase  `https://console.firebase.google.com/?_gl=1*17i2nd3*_ga*OTU0MzkxMC4xNzMxMjQ5NTEx*_ga_CW55HF8NVT*MTczMzMxMTM5My4xMS4xLjE3MzMzMTE1MTIuNDYuMC4w`  

replace your variables in the `.env.example` file  for state management i use `Redux toolkit` and `RTK QUERY` It simplifies handling 

asynchronous data in Redux applications by providing a streamlined way to fetch, cache, update, and manage server state. finally i use `cloudinary service ` for storing, optimizing, and delivering images
